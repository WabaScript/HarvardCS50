1. Prompt user to determine required amount of change
2. Amount must be a positive integer higher than .01
    a. If not an integer or out of range, repeat step 2
3. Convert the given amount from from a float to an inetger
4. Use Greedy Algorithm to print amount of coins to return
    a. Check if .25 is greater than amount and subtract from amount
        i. if true, repeat, else next step
    b. Check if .10 is greater than amount and subtract from amount
        i. if true, repeat, else next step
    c. Check if .05 is greater than amount and subtract from amount
        i. if true, repeat, else next step
    d. Check if .01 is greater than amount and subtract from amount
        i. if true, repeat, else next step
5. Return result to console
